## PublicLibrary.py
Models a public library with three classes: Library, Shelf, and Book. The Shelf class initializes a library with five categories (mystery, classic, poetry, biography, and textbook) and 7 books. Each shelf knows what books it contains. 

This program includes methods to count how many books are in the library, print the contents of both an individual shelf and the entire library, count the number of shelves, and "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf a given book is sitting on.

## ToDoList
This directory contains files to create a user-defined list where it's possible to add and remove tasks. Tasks are added to the top of the list, and a user can click on each item to remove it as it's completed. The user can also hover over each item in the list for a friendly reminder message. This app is hosted as a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/charbitz/3skkowmr/2/
